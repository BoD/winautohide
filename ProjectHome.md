This is a tiny utility that will add an icon in the notification area of the Windows taskbar, and add 4 shortcut keys (Windows+Left, Windows+Right, Windows+Up, Windows+Down).

When you press one of the shortcuts (say Windows+Right for example), the currently active window will "hide" to the right edge of your screen, showing only one pixel of its border. It will also stay "always on top" of other windows, so you will always see this one pixel border.
Then when you hover your mouse on that border, the window will appear and take the focus, so you can use it. When you move back your mouse away from the window, it will hide again.

In effect the window will act like the Windows taskbar when the "auto-hide" setting is checked, or other similar bars (eg. the Google Desktop "sidebar").

This utility can be useful if you have a few small windows that you use often (for example a terminal or a command prompt) and you want to access them quickly just by moving the mouse.

Limitations:
  * Doesn't seem to work with a few "special" windows, like Winamp for example.
  * Multi-monitor setup is not supported / tested.
  * Tested only under Windows XP.

Note: this is actually an [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script, compiled into an executable file.
